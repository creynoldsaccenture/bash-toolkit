# Bash Toolkit
To run this script you'll need to copy the `git_ssh_keys.sh` file ([raw version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creynoldsaccenture/bash-toolkit/master/git_ssh_keys.sh)) and create a new `.sh` file in your home directory. This can be done by entering <code>touch ~/<i>name_of_your_file</i>.sh</code> (i.e. <code>touch ~/git_ssh_keys.sh</code>) in to the terminal.

After this has been done, you will need to copy the contents of the link above into the file you just created and then give the system execute permissions on the file. This can be done by entering <code>chmod +x ~/<i>name_of_your_file</i>.sh</code> into the terminal.

All you need to do then is execute the file by entering <code>~/<i>name_of_your_file</i>.sh</code> in to the terminal.
